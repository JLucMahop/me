I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the LIG laboratory of the University of Grenoble Alpes, France, under the supervision of Prof. [Fabienne Boyer](https://lig-membres.imag.fr/boyer/html/index.html), Prof. [Alain Tchana](https://lig-membres.imag.fr/tchanaa/index.html), and [Baptiste Lepers](https://sites.google.com/view/baptiste-lepers) ASR. My work sits at the crossroads of virtualization, cloud computing, and operating systems—fields that power the backbone of today’s digital world.

Currently, I am designing an innovative approach to reconcile the swapping of virtual machines with high performance and efficiency, tackling a challenge that impacts the scalability and responsiveness of modern cloud infrastructures. By bridging low-level system mechanisms with large-scale distributed architectures, my goal is to make virtualized environments faster, smarter, and more adaptable to real-world demands.

Beyond my current project, I am driven by a broader vision: to contribute research that not only advances theory but also delivers tangible, impactful solutions. I aspire to become a recognized research scientist, turning ambitious ideas into technologies that shape the future of computing.
